% This popularity, said Hammond, means that "open source is taking over.

% "We are now seeing open source tech compete with open source tech;

% (Jeffrey Hammond, a Forrester Research VP and Principal Analyst,
% At the All Things Open conference 2014)
% 80% of developers used open source in past 12 months, 99% in India and China,

% Steve Ballmer proclaiming back in 2001 that "Linux is a cancer."
% In the years since then Microsoft certainly attacked Linux like it was a cancer
% — doing everything from sponsoring SCO's copyright attack on Linux to claiming
% that Linux violated unnamed Microsoft patents to endless FUD assaults.
% After decades of resistance, Microsoft supports a variety of open-source programs
% Microsoft is acutely aware that Azure is the only purely proprietary cloud out here.
% All its competition — Amazon Web Services, Google Compute, OpenStack,
% etc. — all run on Linux and offer Linux server services.
% Nadella admitted that 20 percent of the operating systems on Azure are Linux.

% Microsoft's participation in these efforts underscores the fact
% that nothing has changed more in the last couple of decades
% than how software is fundamentally built. Today most software is built collaboratively.
% The very nature of open source development is to accelerate technology,
% which is why competition today is so fierce and things move faster than ever before.

% As the first major computer company to make Open Source development a key part of its
% ongoing software strategy, Apple remains committed to the Open Source development model.
% Apple uses software created by the Open Source community [...] and returns its enhancements
% to the community.
% Apple believes that using Open Source methodology makes Mac OS X a more robust,
% secure operating system, as its core components have been subjected to the crucible
% of peer review for decades. Any problems found with this software can be immediately
% identified and fixed by Apple and the Open Source community.
% https://www.apple.com/opensource/

% Open source is now pervasive among the developer community, says [analyst Al Hilwa, of IDC]. "This is something that Microsoft cannot ignore."

\begin{frame}{The problem}

% Students use software in labs and for assignments.

% In labs and for assignments are software-dependent.

\begin{itemize}
 \item students are becoming (only) software users instead of scientists
 \item students mix software details and general concepts
 \begin{itemize}
  \item saying Shapefile or feature class instead of

 \item bonding with software limits flexibility
 \item software promotes software/vendor-specific formats/technologies

\begin{frame}{The solution}

\begin{itemize}
 \item lectures:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item theory, concepts

  \item relate to given lecture

  \begin{itemize}
   \item GRASS GIS (free and open source)
   \item ArcGIS (proprietary)

 \end{itemize}
  \pause
  \item similar task in both
%   \item students see two different examples of one workflow
