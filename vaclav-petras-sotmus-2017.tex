\begin{frame}{The problem}

% Students use software in labs and for assignments.

% In labs and for assignments are software-dependent.

\begin{itemize}
 \item students are becoming (only) software users instead of scientists
 \item students mix software details and general concepts
 \begin{itemize}
  \item saying Shapefile or feature class instead of

 \item software promotes software/vendor-specific formats/technologies
 \item single software choice limits explored algorithms

\pause
\item opportunity to see what is a general concept
        and what is specific to a~particular software
\item they gain flexibility to choose optimal solutions for their future work
