\begin{frame}{The problem}

% Students use software in labs and for assignments.

% In labs and for assignments are software-dependent.

\begin{itemize}
 \item students are becoming (only) software users instead of scientists
 \item students mix software details and general concepts
 \begin{itemize}
  \item saying Shapefile or feature class instead of
    \href{http://www.opengeospatial.org/ogc/glossary/v}{\emph{vector}} data%
    % http://www.opengeospatial.org/ogc/glossary/v

    % http://www.opengeospatial.org/ogc/glossary/r
    \ldots
\end{itemize}
 \item bonding with software limits flexibility
 \item software promotes software/vendor-specific formats/technologies
 \item single software choice limits explored algorithms

\begin{frame}{The solution}

\begin{itemize}
 \item lectures:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item theory, concepts
  \item software-independent
 \end{itemize}
 \item labs and assignments:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item relate to given lecture
  \item hands-on, practical

  \begin{itemize}
   \item GRASS GIS (free and open source)
   \item ArcGIS (proprietary)
  \end{itemize}
 \end{itemize}
  \pause
  \item similar task in both
%   \item students see two different examples of one workflow
  \item opportunity to see what is a general concept
        and what is specific to a~particular software
